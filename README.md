Most great founders don’t hit a home run on their first try. Smart investors know this—and double down on them.

But there’s one category of founders that’s barely investable: teenage founders.
They have the energy and the spark but often lack a concrete idea or the readiness to build their magnum opus.

Instead of waiting around, I propose another way: the BRAVE agreement.

The BRAVE grants an investor the right to invest in any venture the founder starts within a given timeframe.

The founder might sign a BRAVE in exchange for participating in a bootcamp or getting some pre-seed funding, for example.

I drafted this agreement with a school of exceptional soon-to-be founders in mind. But it can be appllied to @nautilusquest, @balajis Network School, etc.

The BRAVE agreement is open-source for anyone to use. It still needs legal vetting, but the core idea is there.

Let a thousand teenage founders bloom! 🚀⚔️
